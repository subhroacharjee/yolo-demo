# Yolo Assignment Repository
My task was to create a nodejs application that will have the following features
1. Api Throttling
2. Rate limiter
3. Middleware
4. Interceptor

# Run this Repository
I have added docker to this repository so, the best way to run it is.
```shell
docker-compose up -d --build
```

# Testing
I have added the postman collection in the repository, import that in your
postman or Insomnia and then test the apis out.

# Todo
Things i might add later for fun
- [ ] Prerelease and release-please workflow
- [ ] Unit tests for controllers
- [ ] Integration tests for the apis.
- [ ] Deployment files for kubernetes.
